          I&quot;m Austin, a junior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and
          Economics. My interests range from full-stack development to financial
          econometrics, and everything in between, including AI/ML, cloud
          computing, trading, development economics, and data science.

          My goal is to leverage my technical skills to become an entrepreneur
          that solves problems faced by developing countries, especially those
          surrounding AI adoption at individual and corporate levels as well as
          everyday issues that are often overlooked.

          In my free time, I enjoy watching and playing basketball, playing the
          guitar and piano, traveling to new countries, exploring different
          fashion styles, and eating good food.
